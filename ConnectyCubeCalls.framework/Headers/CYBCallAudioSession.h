 When set to YES, WebRTC will initialize and start the audio unit when it is
 needed (e.g. due to establishing an audio connection).
 This property was introduced to work around an issue where if an AVPlayer is
 playing audio while the VoIP audio unit is initialized, its audio would be
 either cut off completely or played at a reduced volume. By preventing
 the audio unit from being initialized until after the audio has completed,
 we are able to prevent the abrupt cutoff.
