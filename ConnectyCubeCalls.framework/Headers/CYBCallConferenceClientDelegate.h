 @discussion this callback is triggered when serber reports trouble either sending or receiving media on the specified connection, typically as a consequence of too many NACKs received from/sent to the user in the last second: for instance, a slowLink with uplink=true means you notified several missing packets from server, while uplink=false means server is not receiving all your packets.

 @note useful to figure out when there are problems on the media path (e.g., excessive loss), in order to possibly react accordingly (e.g., decrease the bitrate if most of our packets are getting lost).
