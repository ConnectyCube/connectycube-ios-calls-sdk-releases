/**
 Connection state.

 - CYBCallConnectionStateUnknown: connection state is unknown; this can occur when non of the others states are fit for the current situation
 - CYBCallConnectionStateNew: connection was created and ready for the next step
 - CYBCallConnectionStatePending: connection is in pending state for other actions to occur
 - CYBCallConnectionStateConnecting: one or more of the ICE transports are currently in the process of establishing a connection
 - CYBCallConnectionStateChecking: the ICE agent has been given one or more remote candidates and is checking pairs of local and remote candidates against one another to try to find a compatible match, but has not yet found a pair which will allow the peer connection to be made; it's possible that gathering of candidates is also still underway
 - CYBCallConnectionStateConnected: connection was performed successfully
 - CYBCallConnectionStateDisconnected: disconnected, but not closed; can still be reconnected
 - CYBCallConnectionStateClosed: connection was closed
 - CYBCallConnectionStateCount: ICE connection reached max numbers
 - CYBCallConnectionStateDisconnectTimeout: connection was disconnected by timeout
 - CYBCallConnectionStateNoAnswer: connection did not receive answer from the opponent user
 - CYBCallConnectionStateRejected: connection was rejected by the opponent user
 - CYBCallConnectionStateHangUp: connection was hanged up by the opponent user
 - CYBCallConnectionStateFailed: one or more of the ICE transports on the connection is in the failed state; this can occur on the different circumstances, e.g. bad network etc
